### What Is This Site?

**MoonRocks** is place to upload and host Lua modules.

Register an account and upload a `.rockspec` to create a new module.

Every user has their own module manifest. If you want to publish your module to
the root manifest then click *Add To Manifest* from the module's page. Then
anyone can install your module if they've configured their LuaRocks as shown above. 

After you have uploaded a `.rockspec`, you can upload `.rock` files for a
specific version by going to the version's page. Rock files ensure that your
module will be installable as long as this site is up.
