### What Is This Site?

**MoonRocks** is place where anyone can upload and host Lua modules.

Register an account and upload a `.rockspec` to create a new module. If your
module name is not taken it will be added to the *root manifest*.

After you have uploaded a `.rockspec`, you can upload `.rock` files for a
specific version by going to the version's page. Rock files ensure that your
module will be installable as long as this site is up.
