# SSGA.LUA

A small and fast server side LUA visit tracker module for Google Analytics

## What is this??

It is a very simple, very basic, Google Analytics server side tracker.  
It is written in LUA and only works in tandem with Nginx+LUA module or
OpenResty (a distribution of Nginx stuffed with a lot of 3rd party modules,
including HttpLuaModule).

## Inspiration

## Install

## Project Status

The project was born after a couple of hours of hacking.  
It is very simple and very, very basic.Currenty it only tracks page
views, so none of the adavanced tracking capabilities are available.
